1. [How-To Make an Accordion ](http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp)

    I used this page from W3Schools to teach me how to make an accordion. Believe it or not, I've never attempted one before.

### Comments

1. Okay, I'm starting to think my make-believe web designer license needs to be revoked because it took me about five hours to figure out how to make a simple accordion. x_x I looked for *hours* for a nice jQuery accordion plugin, but unfortunately, all of the ones (no fewer than seven) I liked and tried to implement wouldn't work no matter what I tried. So, I hope you don't mind this simple one.

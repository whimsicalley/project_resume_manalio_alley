## Resources

1. [How-To Make an Accordion ](http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp)

    I used this page from W3Schools to teach me how to make an accordion. Believe it or not, I've never attempted one before.

2. [jQuery Super Simple Text Rotator](http://www.thepetedesign.com/demos/jquery_super_simple_text_rotator_demo.html)

    I used this jQuery plugin to make my footer a little more interesting. It's a simple plugin that allows text to fade in and out.

3. [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/get-started/)

    Font Awesome was used throughout my site in order to showcase icons rather than image files to make my life easier, and the browser faster.

4. [Show off your skills with CSS animated bars](http://designify.me/tutorials/show-off-your-skills-with-css-animated-bars/)

    I used this page to learn a basic method for creating a skills bar after researching for a jQuery plugin and coming up empty-handed.

5. [CSS3 @keyframes Rule](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-keyframes.asp)

    Used as a refresher for how to use keyframe animations.

6. [visuallyhidden](https://davidwalsh.name/html5-boilerplate)

    Used this site to find code for "visuallyhidden," a class that hides headers for stylistic purposes but helps screen readers understand the hierarchy of the content.

7. [BackStretch](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/)

    I used this jQuery plugin to add a dynamic background to my webpage. I thought my page looked a little empty and lackluster, and since we used this plugin in class, I knew it would really bring my project to life.


### Comments

1. Okay, I'm starting to think my make-believe web designer license needs to be revoked because it took me about five hours to figure out how to make a simple accordion. x_x I looked for *hours* for a nice jQuery accordion plugin, but unfortunately, all of the ones (no fewer than seven) I liked and tried to implement wouldn't work no matter what I tried. So, I hope you don't mind this simple one.

2. Something that really bugs me is how the accordion opens. I tried a number of times to change "toggle" in the main.js to toggleFade, etc only to have the console give me error messages. I also tried to add a keyframe animation to it, and even though that *would* have worked, unfortunately it would also not allow the skills bar to properly animate.

3. My custom jQuery is in the contacts section. When you click the "Let's be Friends" header, a paragraph tag appears thanking you for stopping by.

4. This project was so much fun! I worked really hard on it and I think it shows. :) In fact, this is probably my favorite project I've ever done to date. I'm tempted to use a lot of the elements from here in a new portfolio site.

5. I really enjoyed looking through the jQuery plugins; however, I can't help but mention how difficult finding quality plugins was! Your list was extremely helpful. I look forward to learning more about them, because they really make such a huge difference with little effort.

## Resources

1. [How-To Make an Accordion ](http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp)

    I used this page from W3Schools to teach me how to make an accordion. Believe it or not, I've never attempted one before.

2. [jQuery Super Simple Text Rotator](http://www.thepetedesign.com/demos/jquery_super_simple_text_rotator_demo.html)

    I used this jQuery plugin to make my "intro" a little more interesting.

3. [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/get-started/)

    Font Awesome was used throughout my site in order to showcase icons rather than image files to make my life easier, and the browser faster.

4. [Show off your skills with CSS animated bars](http://designify.me/tutorials/show-off-your-skills-with-css-animated-bars/)

    I used this page to learn a basic method for creating a skills bar after researching for a jQuery plugin and coming up empty-handed.

5. [CSS3 @keyframes Rule](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-keyframes.asp)

    Used as a refresher for how to use keyframe animations.

6. [visuallyhidden](https://davidwalsh.name/html5-boilerplate)

    Used this site to find code for "visuallyhidden," a class that hides headers for stylistic purposes but helps screen readers understand the hierarchy of the content.


### Comments

1. Okay, I'm starting to think my make-believe web designer license needs to be revoked because it took me about five hours to figure out how to make a simple accordion. x_x I looked for *hours* for a nice jQuery accordion plugin, but unfortunately, all of the ones (no fewer than seven) I liked and tried to implement wouldn't work no matter what I tried. So, I hope you don't mind this simple one.

2. Something that really bugs me is how the accordion opens. I tried a number of times to change "toggle" in the main.js to toggleFade, etc only to have the console give me error messages. I also tried to add a keyframe animation to it, and even though that *would* have worked, unfortunately it would also not allow the skills bar to properly animate.
